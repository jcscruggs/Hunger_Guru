# Hunger_Guru
A web app solution to the problem of choosing what to eat without restaurant overload. 
This is a personal project that I decided to create after many hours wasted scrolling through the endless google pages containing restaurants. 

In most cities there is almost too many restaurants to choose from no matter the cusisine type. This large collection of restaurants can cause stress and anxiety in some people including myself when trying to sift through them

Hunger guru is designed to limit this anxiety by cutting down on the almost limitless choices. The user will only need to enter a location, cuisine type, and a few other criteria to get a short list of restaurants.

This is the intial design of Hunger Guru but if all goes well I will be adding other features. 

This app is built with ASP.net core MVC, Boostrap, and C#.

this project leverages the Zomato API which is a REST api that is a collection of GET requests pertaining to restaurants.
